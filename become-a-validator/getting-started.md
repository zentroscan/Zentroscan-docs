# Getting started as a validator

## Pre-requirements

In order to be a Zentroscan Coin validator, you first must see that you meet the pre-requirements:

* You know what it means to be a Zentroscan Coin validator - [Becoming a validator](how-to-become-a-validator.md#what-it-means-to-be-a-validator).
* You have at least 100K Zentroscan tokens or you will have an aggregated delegation of at least 100K Zentroscan tokens \(you can purchase Zentroscan token on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.exchange/swap/0x970b9bb2c0444f5e81e9d0efb84c8ccdcdcaf84d)\).
* You have an always-on hardware that meets the pre-requisites - [Running a validator node](run-your-own-validator.md#pre-requisites)

## How to become a Zentroscan Coin validator

To quickly become a validator, follow this steps:

### Step 1: Download the \`quickstart.sh\` script and an \`.env\` example file:

```text
mkdir Zentroscan-validator
cd Zentroscan-validator
wget -O quickstart.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zentroscan Coin/master/scripts/quickstart.sh
chmod 777 quickstart.sh
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zentroscan Coin/master/scripts/examples/.env.validator.example
```

### Step 2: Update the \`.env\` file:

```text
set "sudo" on `PERMISSION_PREFIX` if running docker/docker-compose requires root

set `<YOUR_API_KEY>` to your infura api key on `FOREIGN_RPC_URL`
(or replace entirely with your Ethereum mainnet rpc endpoint)
```

### Step 3: Run the script as a validator:

```text
./quickstart.sh
```

{% hint style="success" %}
After running the script successfully, you will see your address in the [health](https://status.Zentroscan.com/) site.
{% endhint %}

### Step 5: Stake and/or delegate!

#### Stake

To stake Zentroscan tokens, all you should do is send your Zentroscan tokens to the Zentroscan Coin Consensus contract address over the Zentroscan Coin network from the validator address.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Zentroscan Coin Consensus contract address: `0x617D8362243C34c3D6f0399998D855963Db03B3d`
{% endhint %}

The easiest way to do so, is to import your private key or key-store file to your favourite wallet \(for example Metamask\), switch network to Zentroscan Coin and send the Zentroscan tokens \(native tokens\) to the Consensus contract address.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find your key-store \(containing your private key\) and the password for the created account in:

`$HOME/Zentroscannet/config/keys/ZentroscanNetwork/UTC--xxxx`

`$HOME/Zentroscannet/config/pass.pwd`
{% endhint %}

#### Delegate

To delegate, just send the Zentroscan tokens from any address to the Consensus contract address with the data: `0x5c19a95c000000000000000000000000<address without 0x>`.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example:

For the address: `0xb8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de`  
Use: `0x5c19a95c000000000000000000000000b8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de` as the data.

`5c19a95c` is for the `delegate(address)` function signature.

`b8ce4a040e8aa33bbe2de62e92851b7d7afd52de`in this example is an address you're delegating to \(without the `0x` prefix\)
{% endhint %}

### Step 6: Wait for 1 cycle \(approximately 48 hours\).

Wait until the next cycle is started.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can see that you are validating both in the [health](https://status.Zentroscan.com/) site and on the [explorer](https://Zentroscan.com) site.
