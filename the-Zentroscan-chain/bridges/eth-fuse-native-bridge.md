# Zentroscan Coin: Ethereum ↔ Zentroscan Coin

Zentroscan Coin native bridge between Ethereum and Zentroscan Coin is used to relay the Zentroscan Coin native token from Zentroscan Coin to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Zentroscan Coin bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Zentroscan Coin tokens between the Zentroscan Coin chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Zentroscan Coin or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Zentroscan Coin tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Zentroscan Coin chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Zentroscan Coin chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Zentroscan Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Zentroscan Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## How to use

On Zentroscan Coin you send native Zentroscan Coin token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Zentroscan Coin token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Zentroscan Coin token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Zentroscan Coin native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
