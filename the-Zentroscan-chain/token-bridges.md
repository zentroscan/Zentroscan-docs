# Token Bridges

We have two bridges as explained below

1. Zentroscan Coin Bridge:  ****The bridge, based on POA's bridge implementation, is used to transfer Zentroscan Coin tokens between the Zentroscan Coin chain and the Ethereum network.
2. Zentroscan20 token bridge: This bridge is used to transfer Zentroscan20 tokens into Zentroscan Coin chain and back. Please not that Zentroscan Coin bridge is not supposed to be used to transfer  . 

The bridge, based on POA's bridge implementation, is used to transfer Zentroscan Coin tokens between the Zentroscan Coin chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Zentroscan Coin or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender.

The validators of the bridge on both network are the Zentroscan Coin chain validators. This means that validators, as part of their governance responsibilities, also need to validate bridge transactions and therefore hold Zentroscan Coin tokens to "approve" bridge transactions on Zentroscan Coin chain and hold ETH to "approve" transactions on Ethereum.

Each bridge transaction must be approved by a majority \(over 50%\) of the validators in order to be processed successfully.

The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Zentroscan Coin tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Zentroscan Coin chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Zentroscan Coin chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Zentroscan Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Zentroscan Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

**Update Zentroscan Coin chain validators on Ethereum**

Each cycle the Zentroscan Coin chain validators are selected from a random snapshot of pending validators.

Those validators, being also the bridge validators, need to be updated on Ethereum as well.

This works by listening to the \`InitiateChange\` event emitted by the Consensus contract on Zentroscan Coin chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Zentroscan Coin chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to set the bridge validators on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

**Using the bridge**

**Transfering from Ethereum mainnet to Zentroscannet** - Send your erc20 Zentroscan Coin tokens to the Ethereum bridge for them to be released from the Zentroscan Coin chain bridge and be avaliable in your native Zentroscan Coin wallet.

**Transfering from Zentroscannet to Ethereum mainnet** - Send your Native Zentroscan Coin tokens to the Zentroscan Coin chain bridge for them to be released from the mainnet bridge and be avaliable in your Mainnet wallet.
